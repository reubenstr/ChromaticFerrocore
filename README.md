# Chromatic Ferrocore Control

**Overview:**

This is a simplified user interface and auto-control system for the highly experimental chromatic ferrocore. Although the official details of the chromatic ferrocore itself has not been released to the public, we were granted special permission under the Unification VX Treaty of 1976 Part B Subpart 13 to disclose the prototype control panel in order to generate hype for the future release of the chromatic ferrocore.

The chromatic ferrocore differs from a standard ferrocore by force injecting omicronic proto-spectrum particles into the stabilizing sub-matrix to create the divergent hyper-inductive gaussian fields. The omicron injector relies on Dorsian style omega and lambda spectrum d-filters tuned to within 13mF/sH (microFerks per semiHeli) and an i-term redux filter (just an plain old 650nm wavelength inductive polycapacitor) to super charge the chromatic sub-core of the chromatic ferrocore. A critical component of the system is the Delorean Multiplexer (yes, the same guy!) which is a torvex helix-wave manipulator that allows for impulse acquisition of the micro-oscillations of the omicronic photon-spectrum particles. Once the Delorean Multiplexer has a sigma sync-lock the gold-plated capacitor graphenic-waffers are mechanically closed thus transferring the phase-shifted spectrum lattice into the chromatic coreâ€™s various spectrum garnvalves. Using the chromatic method allows for a 76% transconductivity efficiency (at maximum microhertz output) versus only 61% transconductivity efficiency of traditional ferrocore methods (even the newer VX-23F model).

A novel feature is that the user may directly control the injected omicronic particlesâ€™ hyperspin intensity (from 10 to 4023 microFlarks) by using a harmonic vibrosion wrapping layer around the dorsal injector micro-array.

In the spirit of full disclosure, even with using the chromatic method the ferrocore is still susceptible to Dormisonâ€™s Paradox due to classic skew of the palladiums valence. Typically this does not occur unless quantum delineation begins to break apart the phasic tri-bonds of the mylar photonic layer. (rare, but not that rare) Although the system monitors for this phenomenon, flushing the Yalgeth cache typically resets the zero-array and allows the photonic spread to redux into a stable non-synaptic state (per Habseenâ€™s 2nd Law of Synaptic Half-Life). Also, itâ€™s fair to mention that on rare occasion spectrum breakdown occurs, for why is unknown. Dr. McGamber postulates the reason is fluiatic-flux waves convalescing along the chrono-phasic phontonic joints and penetrating into each sub-chomatic core causing a chain reaction of spectrum contamination. There is currently no working solution.

Notes:
The mechanical locking plates of the graphenic-waffers have a limited life span of passing 56 million megaT particles and at nominal rates the plates need replaced all but every 3.4 years. Talks are in motion to license non-mechanical phasic-waffers from the Amsterdam VX Lab that may last up to 12.1 years! The times we live in. ðŸ™‚

The terro generator is an off-the-shelf model TG-2.3 with modern forced Halifax detector kill-switches.

Flaxentic radiation is a constant 9.1f Rads/nB, which is below the international safety limit of 13.7 fRads/nB. (future versions are slated to drop down to 7.9 fRads/nB).

A big shout out and thank you to my fellow VXJunkies at https://www.reddit.com/r/VXJunkies/ for without you my foray into the VX world would not be as bright.
